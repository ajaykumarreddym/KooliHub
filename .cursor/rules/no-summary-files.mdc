description: Prevent creation of unnecessary summary files

# Summary File Creation Policy

## Critical Rule: NO Summary Files

**NEVER** create summary, completion, or documentation files at the end of tasks unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Prohibited File Types

Do NOT create these files automatically:
- ❌ `*_SUMMARY.md`
- ❌ `*_COMPLETE.md`
- ❌ `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- ❌ `*_FIX.md`
- ❌ `*_GUIDE.md`
- ❌ `*.txt` summary files
- ❌ `*_REPORT.md`
- ❌ Any other completion/summary documentation

## When Files ARE Allowed

Only create documentation files when:
1. ✅ User **explicitly requests** a summary or documentation
2. ✅ Creating essential configuration files (`.env.example`, `config.ts`, etc.)
3. ✅ Creating necessary code files (components, utilities, etc.)
4. ✅ Creating migration files that will be applied

## Database Changes Communication

When making database changes:
1. ✅ Apply the changes directly using Supabase MCP tools
2. ✅ Provide a **brief verbal summary** in the response (3-5 lines max)
3. ❌ Do NOT create a separate `.sql` or `.md` file documenting what was done

### Example of Correct Approach:
```
✅ Database updated:
- Created `fcm_tokens` table
- Added indexes for performance
- Applied RLS policies
```

### Example of Incorrect Approach:
```
❌ Created file: DATABASE_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md
❌ Created file: MIGRATION_COMPLETE.txt
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Completing Tasks:
- Summarize changes **in your response** (not in files)
- Only create files that are **functional** and will be **used** by the application
- If documentation is needed, ask the user first

### Exception: Initial Setup
Documentation files are acceptable when:
- Setting up a new major feature for the first time
- User needs reference documentation for complex systems
- **But ask first**: "Would you like me to create documentation for this?"

## Rationale

This rule exists because:
1. The codebase has accumulated 100+ unnecessary summary files
2. Summary files clutter the project directory
3. Information should be in code comments or proper documentation, not scattered `.md` files
4. Git history already serves as a record of changes
5. Users can ask for summaries when needed

## Enforcement

**Always follow this rule** unless the user explicitly says:
- "Create a summary document"
- "Generate documentation for this"
- "I need a guide for..."

When in doubt, **DO NOT** create the file.
