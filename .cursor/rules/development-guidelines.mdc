# KooliHub Development Guidelines

## General Development Principles

### Package Management
- **ALWAYS** use `pnpm` for package management (never npm or yarn)
- Use `pnpm add` for production dependencies
- Use `pnpm add -D` for development dependencies

### API Endpoint Strategy
- **MINIMIZE** server endpoints - only create when strictly necessary
- Use server endpoints for:
  - Private key handling
  - Database operations requiring server-side logic
  - Authentication/authorization logic
  - File uploads
- **AVOID** creating endpoints for simple CRUD operations that can be done client-side with Supabase

### TypeScript Configuration
- TypeScript strict mode is **disabled** for flexibility
- Path aliases are configured:
  - `@/*` for client code
  - `@shared/*` for shared types
- All files should use TypeScript (.ts/.tsx extensions)

### Code Style & Standards
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Prefer arrow functions for component definitions
- Use the `cn()` utility for conditional CSS classes
- Import React hooks from 'react' (not destructured)
- Use Zod for runtime validation where appropriate

### Error Handling
- Enhanced ResizeObserver error handling is already implemented in [App.tsx](mdc:client/App.tsx)
- Implement proper error boundaries for React components
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Use React Query for server state management
- Lazy load routes and components where appropriate
